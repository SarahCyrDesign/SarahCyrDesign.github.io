<p>A triple facet Artist! Graphic Designer | Web Developer | Illustrator.  I'm also an avid retro gamer and frilly tea blogger. I received my BA in Illustration from Sacred Heart University and am currently a Graphic Design Manager at The Cheshire Herald Newspaper. I've been painting and drawing ever since I can remember and my love of coding has become my new medium of choice! I believe creativity can be applied to anything you put your mind to whether it be from a brush or a keyboard. Join me on my new coding adventures!</p>
