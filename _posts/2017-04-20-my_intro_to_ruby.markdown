Almost into my second week in the Web Development curriculum and there is already so much I am taking in. Before appraoching the lessons I had in mind devoting about 20 hours a week/4 hours for 5 days/breaks on weekends. Now that I have completed a full week, I have re-evaluated this and determined that reaching checkpoints or milestones is a better approach to my style of learning. Labs have taken longer to complete and I find myself glancing at the clock and seeing an hour seemingly pass by in minutes. What seems to be working is studying lessons during the day and doing the labs at night when I can.  In order to further digest material, I often go back to a previous day's lesson and re-read/re-do excercises to make sure it sinks in more. It almost feels like a wave crashing on the material and sweeping it back in.

# Highlights so far
**Interpolation**
```
def greeting(name)
    puts "Hello #{name}!"
	end
	
	greeting("Programmer")
	
=> Hello Programmer!
```


*	This was the first new concept for me since starting this course. Ruby seemed to have many similarities to JavaScript, which I have a basic knowledge of so far, but never used this term before. You can inject the argument right into your code and have it read when you call it, switching out anything you like!

**I love the irb!**

*I found the irb from the terminal very useful when practicing

*Sometimes having a little too much fun*

**The CLI**
```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require_relative "../lib/greeting.rb"
  puts "Hi! I'm HAL, what's your name?"
  name = gets.strip
greeting(name)
```

*The Command Line Interface especially fascinated me as it was a means to communicate to the user and prompt & store the user's input.
This was prominent when it came down to building the tic tac toe game*

**Progress so far**
**Week 2**
**75% Into to Ruby**
