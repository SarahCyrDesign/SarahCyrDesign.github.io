Who would have thought I would be already more than halfway through the curriculum already, especially after maintaining a full-time job and affording only 3 hours a day for the Learn.ide. After overcoming my first hurdle of completing a CLI data gem, I have a new sense of validation with my coding skills. There are still more ountains to climb, but I am no longer disheartened that it is impossible.

When learning SQL, ORMs, ActiveRecord and Rack/Sinatra, I connected how object models, databases and the server/client relationships connect to one another. Logic is the glue that binds them all. It was also fun to see your code function in the browser when booting up the local server while utilizing Sinatra. Next up is creating forms with Sinatra!
