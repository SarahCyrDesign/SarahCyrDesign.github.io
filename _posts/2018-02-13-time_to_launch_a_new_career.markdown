Upon graduating a few week's ago, the time has now come to be on the hunt for a new job. I must admit, this is a bit intimidating for me as I am used to the planned out structure from the curriculum and now am free to start new projects or build upon existing ones. *What should I focus on now?*  After meeting new tech professionals and networking, I realized that design remains my passion and therefore should focus much of my future projects and job searching on either UI/UX or front end development as these positions merge code and design together wonderfully.

The foremost idea in my mind is to add styling and responsiveness to my current apps, most notably my Sinatra and Rails app. Foundation from Zurb seems to be the way to go as a framework since many industries are utilizing their templates and libraries. I would also like to get to no Sass better as a compiler. The challenge I will have to face is integrating the frameworks within my existing projects. * It's time to hit the documentation!*
