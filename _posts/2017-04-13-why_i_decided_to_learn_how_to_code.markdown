If I were to describe myself in the clearest possible way, it would be comparing my thought process to dropping a stone into the river as it keeps sinking deeper and deeper. So many thoughts flow through my head and sometimes they are hard to convey to others as I try to catch them with my own butterfly net as they flutter about... but that's why I am prepared today with coffee.

I have always wanted to be an artist as far as I can remember. When I was younger, I always imagined I could be a traditional animator from the likes of companies like Disney and had a knack for drawing. Fast forward to my college years where I took up my Illustration major and supplemented with Graphic Design courses inbetween for job stability. When I look back now, I should have noticed patterns in my studying. From Freshman year, the students were required to take a "Computer 101" course, teaching the basics of word, excel, access, etc. I had no problems working through each task fast and efficiently, way ahead of the time allotted in each day. I struggled in math classes in high school, but the only math course in college, "Logic", I grasped the abstract concepts far easier. Finally, the few Graphic Design courses I did take, took me farther after graduation in my job search than my Illustration courses as I was adept to the technical aspects.

I then questioned:
***Did I take the right path?***

Fast forward another 10 years and I find myself working in the Graphic Design print field at a newspaper and not feeling challenged anymore. I thrived in a production environment and even added a new working file system in place on the server for better workflow, but since then, the newspaper industry is continuing to crash. On the side I show my traditional art at galleries, but even that wouldn't feel as fullfilling as it once did. 


***Where was the growth? ***

Creativity was stifled due to the nature of the design business and the industry is overflooded with competing designers. 
When trying to look for a job, I then noticed that many listings asked for technical skills, code skills such as HTML, CSS, 3D applications, etc. It woke me up to the possibility that I needed to start growing and adapt to the world of technology.


***The start of my coding journey***

With a newfound desire for learning I took my first step a few years ago with free coding classes such as codeacademy and W3 Schools. A year later, I wanted to invest in a guided online program where SkillCrush.com shaped my way of viewing code forever. Code was not to be feared, but embraced and used as another creative art tool just as I would with any brush or Photoshop program. I was bitten by the bug and wanted more. I needed to be challenged and become the problem solver in order to have a more fulfilling life and career.
